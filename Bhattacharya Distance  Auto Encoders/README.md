**Variational Auto Encoders for Generative Modeling using Bhattacharya Distance as Regularizer** 

Variational Auto Encoders are used as a Generative Model where the Encoder is made to output values from a known Distribution mostly Standard Normal Distribution i.e h ~ N(0,I). The Decoder converts that encoder values to an approximation of the input. So basically the input to the Decoder follows Standard Normal Distribution. Once the Model is trained, random fictitious images similar to the input  images distribution can be generated by passing Standard Normal Noise ~ N(0,I) to the Decoder. While training the output of the sample is made to follow Normal Distribution by adding a Regularizer to the Cost function. In Variational Auto Encoders the most common Regularizer is called the Kullbackâ€“Leibler(KL) divergence and it penalizes the Model if the output of the Encoder doesn't follow a Normal Distribution. For two distributions *p(x)* and *q(x)* the KL Divergence is given by

**KL(p,q) = E[log(p(x)/q(x)]**
 
where the expectation is over the distribution *q(x)*. The KL Divergence in our case for each hidden variable having mean **u** and standard deviation **s** with standard Normal Distribution i.e *N(0,1)* is given by 

**0.5 (u^2 + s^2 - log(s^2) - 1)**

Here we experiment with the Regularizer and chose Bhattacharya distance instead of the common Kullback-Leibler(KL) divergence regularizer. The Bhattacharya distance(**BD**) is the negative log of the 
Bhattacharya coeffecient(**BC**) as below
  **BD = -log(BC)**

The Bhattacharya coefficient is a similarlity measure between two probability distributions and for two probability distribution *p(x)* and *q(x)* and is as below 

**BC = \int [p(x)q(x)]^0.5 dx**
